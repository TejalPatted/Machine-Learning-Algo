# Machine-Learning-Algo
This repository contains implementations of machine learning algorithms

1. Decsion Tree - This program implements classification decision tree based on information gain for attributes having categorical vaues 
2. Gaussian Mixture Model - This program aims at assigning soft clusters to data. The program models data using 3 Gaussian Curves using E-M approach. The initial step uses k-means algorithm to identify the model parameters. The output of the program is the model parameters of the 3 gaussian curves. 
3. K-Mean clustering - This program clusters data into 3 clusters. The output gives the centroids of the 3 stable clusters.
