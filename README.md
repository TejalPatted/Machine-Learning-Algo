# Machine-Learning-Algo
This repository contains implementations of machine learning algorithms. Most of the algoritms are implemented from scratch using the mathematical derivations that the algorithms are based on. All codes are in python 2.7.

1. Decsion Tree - This program implements classification decision tree based on information gain for attributes having categorical vaues 
2. Gaussian Mixture Model - This program aims at assigning soft clusters to data. The program models data using 3 Gaussian Curves using E-M approach. The initial step uses k-means algorithm to identify the model parameters. The output of the program is the model parameters of the 3 gaussian curves. 
3. K-Mean clustering - This program clusters data into 3 clusters. The output gives the centroids of the 3 stable clusters.
4. Gaussian Mixture model - This model creates a soft clusteing of data points into 3 clusters
5. Linear regression
6. Logistic regression - Mathematical implementation, implemenation of the model using scikit learn
7. Dimensionality reduction techniques - OCA, Fastmap
8. Artificial Neural Network - This model is built without using the Deep learning libraries like keras, Tensorflow or Theona. The model is capable of recognizing image classification
9. KNN - This program implements knn for iris data using eucledian distance
